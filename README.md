# MovieLens 100k Movie Recommendation and Rating Prediction
Our teams code for testing a variety of models on the MovieLens Dataset.
All models should be able to run with the correct dependencies installed and by changing the location of the movielens-100k dataset in each notebook file

## Recommender Systems
We have designed two item similarity models, two user-similarity models, and one hybrid user-similarity model.

The user-similarity and hybrid user-similarity recommenders are accessible from the 'User Similarity Recommender' notebook.\
The movie-cosine similarity and correlation based recommenders are accessible from the "Item-Based Cosine Similarity& Correlation - Finding Similar Movies" notebook.

## Rating Prediction Models
We have designed an Item-Item Collaborative Filtering (Weighted-Average) model, a Gradient Boosting (Ensemble Learning) model and a Latent Factor (Matrix Factorisation) model.

The Item-Item Collaborative Filtering model is aceesible from the 'Item-Item Prediction' notebook. \
The Gradient Boosting model is accessible from the 'XGBoost Rating Classifier' notebook.\
The Latent Factor Model (Matrix Factorization) is accessible from the "100kMovLen_CF_Matrix Factorization_ratePrediction" notebook.
